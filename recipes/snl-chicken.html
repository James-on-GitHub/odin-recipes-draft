        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The internet (optional, in case of a fire)</li>
            <li>1 whole Chicken</li>
            <li>2 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>200g sautéed onions</li>
            <li>300g Dutch cream potatoes</li>
            <li>30g butter</li>
            <li>A small bunch of chives</li>
            <li>Imagination (in case you don't finish cooking)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the rosemary and sautéed onions onto the chicken.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken into a preheated oven at 400°C for about 30 mins.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional step:</strong> Now you'll have <em>a little time to kill</em> so if you need to search the internet at this time, go ahead.</li>
            <li>Start boiling the potatoes in generously salted water for about 4 mins.</li>
            <li>Double check your oven is actually set to 400°c and not 4000°C. If it's the later feel free to call your local fire department from your favorite website?</li>
            <li>Mix your fresh chives with the butter.</li>
            <li>Now is the time to use your Imagination because this is definitely not the correct way to roast a chicken!</li>
        </ol>
